# Countdown
Admin Controlled Countdown

http://staging.torontossc.com/ in the header, make sure to minimize to display responsive

There is a form in the admin panel that takes 5 inputs:
  - Start Date Time
  - End Date Time
  - Countdown Message
  - Expired Time Message
  - Active Flag
  
The countdown takes the date and calculates the number of days, hours, minutes and seconds til the end date value. After the time is reached, the countdown message changes to the expired message (ex "Registration is open July 13th" -> "Registration is Open"). The countdown disappears after 24hrs. 

The countdown is fully responsive and is design mobile-first.
